# Predicting Cervical Cancer: Seeking Connections Project Overview

In this data science project, the focus is on predicting the likelihood of cervical cancer contraction, a preventable yet significant health threat. With approximately 11,000 new cases diagnosed annually in the U.S., societal influences and lifestyle patterns are explored as key factors. The goal is to empower women by developing a predictive model based on demographics, lifestyle habits, and medical records. The dataset, obtained from the Hospital Universitario de Caracas in Venezuela, includes 858 patients, though privacy concerns led to some '?' values. The study faces challenges such as a limited number of biopsy cases and potential bias in handling unanswered questions. The target variable, Biopsy (0 = no cancer, 1 = cancer), serves as a focal point for assessing predictive accuracy. The refined feature variables, encompassing age, sexual history, and medical conditions, underwent dummy encoding for analysis. Classification techniques, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, were tested along with balancing techniques to address the imbalanced dataset. Evaluation metrics, emphasizing both precision and recall, guide the model development, and hyperparameter tuning ensures optimal performance. This project aims not only to predict cervical cancer risk but also to inform and raise awareness based on individual lifestyle patterns.
